The model's prediction for survival chance of patients with acute stroke is based on various features. 

For example, a higher Apache score of 25.0 is associated with a lower chance of survival, contributing -0.132 to the overall prediction. This means that patients with a higher Apache score are at a higher risk of not surviving.

Similarly, a higher LGI (3240.0) is also correlated with a lower survival chance, contributing -0.081 to the prediction. This suggests that patients with higher LGI values are at a lower risk of survival compared to those with lower LGI values.

Overall, the expected baseline survival chance for all patients is 0.2133, and the model takes into account these features to make individualized predictions.

- An apache score of 21 indicates a slightly lower chance of survival, decreasing the overall model prediction by -0.134.

The model's prediction for a patient with an apache_score of 17 is 0.077 higher than the baseline risk. This means that having a higher apache_score is associated with a slightly increased chance of survival.

On the other hand, a patient with an LGI of 3510 has a contribution of -0.29 to the model's prediction. This suggests that having a higher LGI value is actually associated with a decreased chance of survival compared to the baseline risk. The average LGI value in the dataset is 1831.88, so a value of 3510 is relatively high.

---


The model predicts that patients with a higher apache_score have a higher survival chance compared to the baseline risk. For example, a patient with an apache_score of 18 has a contribution of 0.22 to the model's output, indicating an increased chance of survival.

Similarly, the model also takes into account the LGI (Lymphocyte-to-Granulocyte ratio) value of patients. A higher LGI of 540 contributes 0.17 to the model's output, suggesting a positive impact on the patient's survival chance compared to the baseline risk.

Overall, both apache_score and LGI are important features in predicting the survival chance of patients with acute stroke, with higher values indicating a higher likelihood of survival.
